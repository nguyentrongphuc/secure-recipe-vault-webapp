Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

- Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - UDP
- Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- Port 80 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- Port 5000 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- The IAM policy is not restrictive, allowing full administrative access. There's no IAM password policy
- S3 bucket logging not enabled. and not be encrypted at rest with AWS KMS keys
- VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic.
- Application Load Balancer is not configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

- VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
- Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
- CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
- EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address. Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
- Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
- Set IAM policy to readonly.
- Enable logging for S3 buckets.
- Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS and limit traffic.
- S3 buckets should be encrypted at rest with AWS KMS keys, and enable logging for S3 buckets.
